CCMS: TODO
----------

 - Option to add page HERE from Manage Navigation page
 - Add Description field to content update page
 - text of Add to Viewtree page disappears on submit - alter this.
 - sibling order page seemed to re-submit itself. BUG?
 - edit page props also seems to re-submit itself?
 - Add better reference links to Manage Pages
 - Remove Node: Have ADMINISTRATIVE form on the page to specify the node to remove.
 - remove content: sort out buttons!
 - show subtype on the various content lists
 - close windows when moving between site pages! The popups may retain the page and slot ID - therefore confusion...
